# Standard web app
Example demonstrating different aspects of standard Web application: Static and dynamic pages, REST calls, Large upload/downloads, real-time websockets. Kind of test, that all kinds of standard features can be run in p2p mode too.

Run `cargo run -- -h` for help with command options
